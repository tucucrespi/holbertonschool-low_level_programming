What are macros and how to use them
What are the most common predefined macros
How to include guard your header files
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You dont have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it wont be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you dont have to push them to your repo (if you do we wont take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h
Dont forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded

Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.

1. Pi mandatory
Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.

2. File name mandatory
Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

3. Function-like macro mandatory
Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.

4. SUM mandatory
Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
